        My body, which weighs 1,510 pounds (685 kg), is made up of several parts that can help me function at the highest level of efficiency. I'm built of materials that can resist heat, such as tungsten, niobium, molybdenum, and sapphire, which will enable me to face solar wind particles and the high-temperature layers. Additionally, this image will explain each component's purpose.
        You can have a related question, how can you get this huge power that makes you have this energy to rotate 24 orbits around this huge star with this very high speed? This question had been answered with the projectâ€™s scientist, also from Defense Logistics Agency Energy. 
        According to the project's scientist Nicky Fox, I have given my power to keep the journey going using the two solar panels to receive energy from the sun. Also, the Aerospace Energy division of Defense Logistics Agency Energy said that I have gained high-purity Hydrazine as a fuel. I can travel at an average speed of 692,000 KM/h thanks to these energy sources.
