        “The Birth”
Did you look at the Sun before? For the majority, the answer is yes. They didn’t only look at it, but they had an inquiry about how this thing does work. Not only imaging but also actually asking; for example, some might ask, "what would happen if an astronaut touched the Sun?" It is not odd to hear such a question from someone with the imagination of touching the Sun.
Touching fire is weird, isn’t it? However, touching the sun is not only weird, but it was also imaginary; it is still imaginary for some who don't know about me, the Parker Solar Probe. In 1975, there were a total of 132 orbital launches of satellites. On January 1, 2022, there were 852 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth.	
Did you know that the Corona little is much hotter than the Sun’s surface (the photosphere)? If not, now you know. So, imagine a scientist who knows this and does not know why. Launching me was not only to answer these questions, but also to answer others like how does the solar wind accelerate? And what are the sources of high-energy solar particles? The relation between everything Earth-related to space and the Sun is more than direct. The solar wind, for instance, is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere, the area of space, around a planet, that is controlled by the planet's magnetic field. Getting back to satellites, imagine how much they are affected by the Sun. Moreover, Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, says in a press release, "Not only does this milestone provide us with deeper insights into our Sun's evolution and its impacts on our solar system, but everything we learn about our own star also teaches us more about stars in the rest of the universe.”
The mentioned is just a  portion of what we need to know about the Sun, that is why the project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year. However, the idea of sending a spacecraft to the Sun in 1958. The cost of the project is US$1.5 billion. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory designed and built the spacecraft launched on August 12, 2018.
Hearing about me would make you think about who had the idea to build such an actual thing. Well, there are many who thought so. However, the asked question should be, "Who actually started to work on it?" The name Parker is for the hero Prof. Emeritus Eugene N. Parker. Parker was internationally known for proposing the concept of the solar wind—the same idea that was first met with skepticism to outright ridicule.
In the 1950s, Prof. Parker proposed the existence of the solar wind. He also proposed that the magnetic field in the outer solar system would be in the shape of a Parker spiral; those predictions were later confirmed by spacecraft measurements. The answer to your question "Who came up with the idea of the Parker Solar Probe?" would be Prof. Eugene Newman Parker. I was designed, built, and managed for NASA by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.
