        I know now you wonder if will I stay there forever. Where will I go when I finish the 24 orbits around the Sun? Will I get back home, Earth?
Well, after I will finish the seven years journey peacefully, according to my mission systems engineer at APL (Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory), Jim Kinnison, I will only set to move closer to and faster around the Sun, with the help of two remaining Venus-assisted flybys. Thus, will take place in August 2023 and November 2024. 
Eventually, I will come within 4 million miles (6.2 million kilometers) of the solar surface in December 2024, at speeds topping 430,000 miles per hour, can’t be closer to the sun, right?
The end of my Mission following the very last orbit is June 14, 2025: Perihelion 24, the journey that was a dream for over 60 years and came true.
 I will be able to say I’m done with the task for which I was created. I transmitted all the information I could convey to my last breath; I am not certain of my end, but it is foreseeable that since I shall remain there, by the completion of the twenty-fourth lap I shall have come close enough to burn and die there, I will die with peace of mind and happiness that all of you is able to learn about our great star, the Sun.
