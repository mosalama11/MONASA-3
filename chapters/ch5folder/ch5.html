        Touching the Sun
        Hearing about something touching the Sun would reveal bunches of questions. Did it literally touch the Sun? How did it endure the heat? Why did they send such a thing? And many more questions.
        Firstly, let us go deep to learn about the Sun and its atmosphere. Unlike Earth, the Sun doesn’t have a solid structure. It's a giant ball of hot plasma that's held together by its own gravity. Solar materials flow out of the surface; some materials escape the Sun’s gravity and some are bound by the Sun’s gravity and magnetic field. Those who can escape are the solar wind; remember Prof. Parker? These solar winds are a constant stream of particles out of the Sun; the stream accelerates up to millions of miles per hour out of the Corona. Other materials form the Sun’s atmosphere. The Sun’s atmosphere is made up of four outer layers: the Photosphere, the Chromosphere, the Transition Region, and the Corona.
        At the edge of the atmosphere, there is the Alfvén critical surface, the boundary that marks that edge. Its position was mysterious to us, yet now we know. However, for the first time in human history, a spacecraft could cross it; the spacecraft, by doing this, could actually touch the Sun, specifically the Sun’s outer layer. For the first time in April 2021, the Parker Solar Probe could successfully venture into the Corona.
        One may think why the Corona itself. The Corona is not like other outer surfaces; indeed, its nature is not like anything you can imagine. Imagine fire; what would happen when you get away from it? You feel less heat, don’t you? Unlike anything you may know, while dealing with the Corona, getting away from the center is getting hotter. The Corona is around 300 times hotter than the Photosphere.
        Undoubtedly, we still have other questions we are looking for their answers to; Fortunately, answers are there to be learned by you scientists.
