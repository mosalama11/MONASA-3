        During my mission, I passed by a planet which as they call it Earth’s, the home, twin; it was so heart-touching for me.
        I used the gravity assist (flybys) from Venus five times out of seven until now to bend, straighten my orbit and bring it closer to the Sun. 
        On Friday, Aug. 31, my controllers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory performed a second planned Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM-2). This maneuver, which was carried out with great precision, adjusted my direction to position me for my Venus flyby. I even captured a view of Earth as I sped toward the first Venus gravity assist of the mission on September 25, 2018. On Oct. 3, 2018, I successfully completed this flyby of Venus at about 1,500 miles.
        But in 2020 and 2021, I pointed my cameras “WISPR” (wide-field imager of Solar probe) at the nightside of Venus as I was passing by it during my flybys, but I never thought I would be the very first spacecraft to capture the surface features through the clouds, in wavelengths of the visible spectrum – the type of light that the human eye can see!
        It was the first-time visible light from the Venusian surface has been taken from space. To find out that the surface of Venus is so hot thus, it glows faintly in a very red wavelength, actually, if you don’t know, Venus is considered as the third brightest thing in the sky.
        Regarding Venus, I have found a lot of interesting stuff you would definitely like. The light areas, for instance, are hotter and the dark areas are cooler. The pictures taken show the largest highland in Venus, which is called “Aphrodite Terra.” To realize that, higher elevations tend to be cooler, while the lower regions tend to be hotter. Also, a shining halo of oxygen in the Venusian atmosphere can be seen surrounding the planet.
        The images helped scientists see heat variations; also, understanding the composition of the surface of Venus could teach us about the planet’s surface geology and evolution. As it is today, not hospitable to life with extreme temperatures, toxic clouds, and a crushing atmosphere, but it seems like the past was quite different.
        In 2024, I will have one last chance to image Venus, scientists are hoping that my WISPR images will have a long-term impact on Venus’s research and exploration.
