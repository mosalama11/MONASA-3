        My preparation to launch from my home land Earth started in August 2017, by the end of August; All components of the United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket that will launch NASA’s Parker Solar Probe have arrived for prelaunch processing at Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
        Continuing to verify all my systems to be ready for launching and testing them started on Nov. 3, Nov. 14 and Nov. 27 of 2017, thankfully I passed the vibration testing at APL (Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory), the acoustic testing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt and illumination testing and a check of the solar arrays was done, which will provide electrical power to the spacecraft. The scientists of mine then kept making sure that all of me is ready for the launch environment and will be able to resist all the predicted forces that will impact me. I reached the final major environmental test “the space environment simulation” by entering “the thermal vacuum chamber” on Wednesday, Jan. 17, which simulates the harsh conditions I’ll experience in my journey through space.
        I gladly completed the space environment test and was left out of the “vacuum chamber” after over two months inside, to go through “solar environment simulator”. Later undergoing final preparations, it was finally the time, I launched at 3:31 a.m. EDT on Aug. 12, 2018 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. 
        
        
        
        
        “Despite operating in such an extreme environment, Parker is performing well beyond our expectations,” this is what my project manager Helene Winters said about me. I faced so much challenges since I launched to space, some of them are the harshest ever faced by any other spacecraft, including; temperatures up to nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius), space dust that could easily degrade materials and instruments, and intense light and high-speed particles escaping from our closest star (the Sun).
        Proudly, I was able to withstand all this, and send more than double the required information to Earth, and remained healthy.
