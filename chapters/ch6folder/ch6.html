        The whole chapter (Struggling to keep nearby)
        My start was on August 12, 2018, aboard a Delta IV-Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, USA. My journey will continue for about 7 years. In these years, I should complete 24 orbits, coming as close as a distance of 3.83 million miles from the sun (6.16 million km), facing the sun's radiation. Proudly, I am the first spacecraft to take this tremendous risk. In April 2021, on my 8th orbit, I finally reached the sun and passed through the corona layer of the sun to be in the sunâ€™s outer atmosphere.
        For sure, some of you asked what my function is or why NASA sent me to the sun, and what is the purpose of keeping me as near to the sun as this distance? I can say that I am the only spacecraft that got information that no spacecraft could get.
        I was sent to the Sun by NASA to study it and gather the unprecedented data that researchers on Earth require. So, from these functions, following the path of the energy that the sun's wind and corona use to heat up and accelerate, identifying the magnetic and plasma fields' structure and behavior at the solar wind's sources, and exploring the processes that propel and move energetic particles I currently have samples of the sun's magnetic fields and particles, and I'm working to gather as much information as I can before my job ends (the 24 orbits).
        As the first spacecraft that reached the sun at the closest distance, which is 6.16 million km, I have faced many troubles that can destroy any other spacecraft. While rotating around the sun, there are many deadly challenges, such as facing a temperature up to about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, solar wind particles, intense light, and high-speed particles escaping from the sun. All these challenges could harm my instruments if there was no heat shield, which is made of carbon-composite material, that could defend and keep the rest of my body safe.
